## The Problem with Manual Tracking

If you're still maintaining manual tracking sheets, you know the pain:

- **Every Monday**: Copy-paste time entries from Toggl into Excel
- **Every Tuesday**: Update project status from Jira into your tracking sheet
- **Every Wednesday**: Fix broken formulas and formatting
- **Every Thursday**: Your "live" data is already 3 days outdated

**Teams waste 5-15 hours per week on manual tracking work.** Meanwhile, all this data already exists in your tools—it just needs to be connected.
