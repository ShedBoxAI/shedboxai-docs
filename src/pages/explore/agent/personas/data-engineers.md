# ShedBox Agent for Data Engineers

Automate pipeline creation and reduce maintenance overhead.

## The Data Engineering Challenge

Data engineers spend significant time on:
- Writing repetitive ETL code
- Managing connector maintenance
- Debugging data quality issues
- Handling stakeholder data requests

**ShedBox Agent generates production-ready pipelines from natural language.**

## How Data Engineers Use ShedBox Agent

### Rapid Pipeline Generation

```
You: "Create an ETL pipeline that:
- Pulls from Salesforce Opportunities API
- Joins with our PostgreSQL customers table
- Calculates win rates by segment
- Loads to our data warehouse"

ShedBox Agent:
✓ Generates complete pipeline YAML
✓ Handles API authentication
✓ Includes join logic
✓ Configures warehouse loading
```

### Generated Pipeline

```yaml
data_sources:
  salesforce:
    type: rest_api
    url: https://${SF_INSTANCE}.salesforce.com/services/data/v57.0/query
    auth:
      type: oauth2
      token_url: https://login.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token
      client_id_env: SF_CLIENT_ID
      client_secret_env: SF_CLIENT_SECRET
    params:
      q: "SELECT Id, AccountId, StageName, Amount, CloseDate FROM Opportunity"

  customers:
    type: postgresql
    connection_env: PROD_DATABASE_URL
    query: "SELECT id, segment, region FROM customers"

processing:
  join:
    sources: [salesforce, customers]
    left_key: AccountId
    right_key: id
    type: left

  aggregate:
    group_by: segment
    metrics:
      - total_opps: count
      - won_opps: count(StageName == 'Closed Won')
      - win_rate: won_opps / total_opps
      - total_value: sum(Amount)

output:
  type: postgresql
  connection_env: WAREHOUSE_URL
  table: sales_metrics
  mode: upsert
  key: segment
```

## Key Benefits for Data Engineers

### 1. Faster Development

Generate pipeline scaffolding in seconds:

```
"Create a CDC pipeline for the orders table"
"Set up incremental loading from API X"
"Build a data quality validation pipeline"
```

### 2. Consistent Patterns

Generated pipelines follow best practices:
- Proper error handling
- Idempotent operations
- Incremental processing
- Logging and monitoring hooks

### 3. Self-Service Enablement

Empower stakeholders with supervised self-service:

```yaml
# Stakeholder-friendly pipeline
# Generated by ShedBox Agent, reviewed by data engineering

metadata:
  owner: data-engineering
  reviewers: [jane@company.com]
  stakeholder: marketing-team
  refresh: daily

data_sources:
  marketing_data:
    type: rest_api
    url: https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/objects/contacts
    # ... config ...
```

### 4. Documentation Generation

Auto-generate pipeline documentation:

```
"Document this pipeline with data lineage and transformation logic"
```

## Data Engineering Workflows

### Pipeline Development

```
"Create a template for incremental loading from any REST API"
```

### Data Quality

```yaml
# Generated data quality checks
validation:
  - field: email
    rules:
      - not_null
      - format: email
  - field: amount
    rules:
      - not_null
      - type: numeric
      - range: [0, 1000000]
```

### Debugging

```
"This pipeline is duplicating records. Analyze and suggest fixes"
```

### Migration

```
"Generate a migration plan from Airflow to ShedBoxAI"
```

## Production Patterns

### Orchestration

```yaml
pipelines:
  - name: extract_salesforce
    schedule: "0 */2 * * *"
    timeout: 30m

  - name: transform_data
    depends_on: [extract_salesforce]

  - name: load_warehouse
    depends_on: [transform_data]
```

### Monitoring

```yaml
monitoring:
  metrics:
    - records_processed
    - execution_time
    - error_count

  alerts:
    - condition: error_count > 0
      notify: pagerduty
    - condition: execution_time > 30m
      notify: slack
```

### Testing

```yaml
tests:
  - name: validate_output_schema
    type: schema
    expected:
      - name: segment
        type: string
      - name: win_rate
        type: float

  - name: validate_row_count
    type: assertion
    query: "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM sales_metrics"
    condition: "> 0"
```
