Your team needs project management software. You research options:

**Option A**: Monday.com - Beautiful interface, everyone raves about it
**Option B**: Asana - Your competitor uses it
**Option C**: ClickUp - Cheapest, has every feature imaginable

You pick Monday.com because the demo was impressive. **Cost: $8,000/year**.

**Six months later**:
- Adoption rate: 32% (most still use spreadsheets)
- Features used: 15% (paying for enterprise, using basic)
- Integration with Salesforce: Broken
- Time to migrate to something else: 40 hours
- **Total waste: $4,000 + 40 hours + opportunity cost**

**The real problem**: You never asked the right questions before buying.

## The 5-Question Framework (Takes 5 Minutes)

Before evaluating ANY software, answer these five questions:

### Question 1: What's the Measurable Problem?

**Wrong answer**: "We need better project management"

**Right answer**: "We're losing 8 hours/week per PM to manual status updates. 5 PMs × 8 hours × $75/hour × 50 weeks = $150,000/year waste. Last quarter we missed 3 deadlines, costing $85K in rush fees."

**Why this matters**: If you can't quantify the problem, you can't prove ROI later.

**How to answer it**:
```
Current cost of problem = _______/year
Impact if not fixed = _______
Urgency level (1-10) = _______
```

**Rule**: If urgency &lt;7, don't buy new software yet. Fix process first.

---

### Question 2: What's the Alternative?

**Wrong answer**: "We need to buy software to solve this"

**Right answer**: "Alternatives we considered:
1. Do nothing: Costs $150K/year, problem gets worse
2. Hire another PM: $120K/year + benefits
3. Fix our process: 40 hours upfront, $50K/year ongoing waste
4. Buy software: $8K/year + setup time"

**Why this matters**: Software isn't always the answer. Sometimes process changes, headcount, or doing nothing is better.

**Decision matrix**:
```
Alternative    | Year 1 Cost | Ongoing Cost | Solves Problem? | Risk
Do nothing     | $150K       | $150K/year   | No              | High
Hire PM        | $140K       | $140K/year   | Maybe           | Medium
Fix process    | $50K        | $50K/year    | Partially       | Low
Buy software   | $20K        | $8K/year     | Fully           | Low
```

**Rule**: Only buy software if it's clearly the best alternative on cost AND effectiveness.

---

### Question 3: What's the True Total Cost?

**Wrong answer**: "It costs $8,000/year"

**Right answer**:
```
Year 1 Costs:
┌────────────────────────┬──────────┐
│ Subscription           │  $8,000  │
│ Setup/implementation   │  $3,000  │
│ Data migration         │  $2,000  │
│ Training (20 hours)    │  $1,500  │
│ Integration dev        │  $4,000  │
│ Lost productivity      │  $2,000  │
├────────────────────────┼──────────┤
│ Total Year 1           │ $20,500  │
│ Total Year 2+          │ $10,000  │ (includes support, admin time)
└────────────────────────┴──────────┘
```

**Why this matters**: The sticker price is 40% of the true cost. Hidden costs kill ROI.

**Common hidden costs**:
- Integration development (APIs, connectors, custom code)
- Training (both initial and ongoing for new hires)
- Admin time (managing users, troubleshooting, upgrades)
- Migration costs (moving data from old system)
- Productivity loss during adoption (2-4 weeks ramp-up)
- Support plan (often required for enterprise features)
- Data storage overage (grows over time)

**Rule**: Multiply sticker price by 2.5X for Year 1 true cost, 1.3X for ongoing years.

---

### Question 4: What's the Expected Value?

**Wrong answer**: "It'll save us time and make us more productive"

**Right answer**:
```
Quantified Benefits:

Time Savings:
- Eliminate 8 hours/week manual updates per PM
- 5 PMs × 8 hours × $75/hour × 50 weeks = $150,000/year

Error Prevention:
- Reduce missed deadlines 80% (from 12/year to 2/year)
- Average miss cost: $28,500
- Prevent: 10 × $28,500 = $285,000/year

Opportunity Value:
- PMs gain 8 hours/week for strategic work
- Expected value: 2 additional projects/quarter
- Estimated value: $180,000/year

Total Expected Value: $615,000/year
Conservative (50% adoption): $307,500/year

ROI: (307,500 - 20,500) / 20,500 = 1,400%
```

**Why this matters**: Vague benefits = no accountability = waste.

**Value categories to consider**:
1. **Direct savings** (time, labor, subscriptions replaced)
2. **Revenue increase** (faster delivery, more capacity, better quality)
3. **Risk reduction** (errors prevented, compliance, security)
4. **Opportunity value** (enables new capabilities, strategic initiatives)

**Rule**: If you can't quantify $3 of value for every $1 spent, don't buy.

---

### Question 5: How Will You Track Success?

**Wrong answer**: "We'll monitor adoption and see how it goes"

**Right answer**:
```
Success Metrics (30/60/90-day reviews):

30 Days (Adoption):
✓ &gt;80% weekly active users
✓ &gt;60% of features configured
✓ &lt;5 support tickets per user

60 Days (Leading Indicators):
✓ 6+ hours/week/PM time saved
✓ 40% reduction in status update time
✓ 90% on-time project delivery

90 Days (Financial Validation):
✓ $37,500+ measured time savings (25% of goal)
✓ 2+ deadline misses prevented ($57K saved)
✓ Actual ROI &gt;300%

Kill Criteria:
✗ &lt;50% adoption by Day 60
✗ &lt;3 hours/week time saved by Day 90
✗ &lt;200% ROI by Day 90
```

**Why this matters**: 62% of software purchases never get evaluated for success. They become zombie subscriptions.

**Rule**: Set kill criteria BEFORE buying. Commit to canceling if metrics aren't hit.

## Real Example: Framework in Action

**Scenario**: Marketing team wants marketing automation (HubSpot Marketing)

### Their 5-Question Analysis:

**Q1: Measurable problem?**
- Spending 25 hours/week on manual email sends, list management
- 3 marketers × 25 hours × $60/hour × 50 weeks = $225,000/year
- Missed 8 campaign deadlines last year, estimated $340K pipeline impact

**Q2: Alternatives?**
- Do nothing: $225K/year waste continues
- Hire marketing ops: $95K/year + benefits
- Buy automation: $18K/year + $8K setup

**Q3: True total cost?**
```
Year 1: $34,000
- Subscription: $18,000
- Setup: $8,000
- Training: $4,000
- Integration: $4,000

Year 2+: $22,000/year
```

**Q4: Expected value?**
```
Time savings: $225,000/year
Pipeline improvement: 40% of $340K = $136,000/year
Total value: $361,000/year

ROI: (361,000 - 34,000) / 34,000 = 962%
```

**Q5: Success tracking?**
- 30 days: &gt;85% adoption, 3 campaigns automated
- 60 days: 15+ hours/week saved per marketer
- 90 days: 20%+ more campaigns, $90K+ pipeline increase

**Decision**: Clear yes. ROI 962%, payback 1.1 months.

**Actual result**: 1,140% ROI, exceeded all targets by Month 2.

## Common Decision Mistakes to Avoid

### Mistake 1: "Everyone uses it, so we should too"

**Fix**: Competitors might be wasting money too. Do your own math.

### Mistake 2: "The demo was impressive"

**Fix**: Demos show best-case. Require a 14-day trial with your actual data.

### Mistake 3: "We'll figure out integrations later"

**Fix**: Broken integrations kill 40% of software ROI. Verify before buying.

### Mistake 4: "It's only $X/month, let's try it"

**Fix**: Small subscriptions add up. $200/month × 15 tools = $36K/year waste.

### Mistake 5: "We'll cancel if it doesn't work"

**Fix**: 78% never cancel. Set kill criteria with accountability.
