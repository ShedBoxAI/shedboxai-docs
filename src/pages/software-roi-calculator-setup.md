You've tried tracking software ROI in spreadsheets. The process looks like:

**Week 1**: Spend 6 hours exporting data from 5 different tools
**Week 2**: Spend 4 hours cleaning and formatting
**Week 3**: Spend 3 hours building formulas and charts
**Week 4**: Present results... that are already 3 weeks old

**Total time**: 13 hours per analysis

If you do this quarterly, that's **52 hours per year** of manual workâ€”and the data is always outdated by the time executives see it.

**There's a better way**: Set up automated ROI tracking once, then get fresh analysis whenever you need it with zero manual work.

## What You'll Build

By the end of this guide (20 minutes), you'll have:

âœ… **Automated data collection** from Salesforce, QuickBooks, HubSpot, Stripe, and Xero
âœ… **Real-time ROI calculations** with revenue attribution
âœ… **Monthly trend analysis** showing costs vs. revenue over time
âœ… **Executive reports** generated automatically with AI insights
âœ… **Zero ongoing maintenance** (runs automatically)

**Time to first result**: 20 minutes
**Time to ongoing results**: 0 minutes (fully automated)

---

## Prerequisites (5 Minutes)

Before starting, gather:

### 1. Business Tool Access

You need **read-only API access** to at least one cost source + one revenue source:

**Cost sources** (pick at least one):
- QuickBooks Online (most common)
- Xero
- Your accounting system with API access

**Revenue sources** (pick at least one):
- Salesforce
- HubSpot CRM
- Your CRM with API

**Optional but recommended**:
- Stripe (payment processing data)
- Additional CRMs (if you use multiple)

### 2. API Credentials

For each tool you're connecting, you'll need:

**Salesforce**:
- Instance URL (e.g., `yourcompany.my.salesforce.com`)
- Access Token or OAuth credentials
- [Get Salesforce API credentials â†’](https://developer.salesforce.com/)

**QuickBooks**:
- Company ID
- Access Token
- [Get QuickBooks API credentials â†’](https://developer.intuit.com/)

**HubSpot**:
- Access Token (Private App)
- [Get HubSpot API credentials â†’](https://developers.hubspot.com/)

**Stripe**:
- Secret Key (starts with `sk_live_` or `sk_test_`)
- [Get Stripe API credentials â†’](https://stripe.com/docs/keys)

**Xero**:
- Access Token
- Tenant ID
- [Get Xero API credentials â†’](https://developer.xero.com/)

*Note: All credentials require "read-only" access. You don't need write permissions.*

### 3. Technical Setup

**Install ShedBoxAI**:
```bash
pip install shedboxai
```

**Requirements**:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- Internet connection
- Text editor

That's it. No database, no complex infrastructure.

## Step-by-Step Setup (15 Minutes)

### Step 1: Download the Configuration Template (1 min)

```bash
# Download production-ready config
wget /software-roi-calculator-production.yaml

# Or download manually from browser:
# /software-roi-calculator-production.yaml
```

This template includes:
- Pre-configured connections for 5 business tools
- ROI calculation formulas
- Attribution logic
- Executive report generation

### Step 2: Create Environment Variables File (3 min)

Create a file named `.env` in the same directory:

```bash
# Salesforce credentials
SALESFORCE_INSTANCE=yourcompany.my.salesforce.com
SALESFORCE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here

# QuickBooks credentials
QUICKBOOKS_COMPANY_ID=your_company_id
QUICKBOOKS_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here

# HubSpot credentials
HUBSPOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here

# Stripe credentials
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your_key_here

# Xero credentials
XERO_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_token_here
XERO_TENANT_ID=your_tenant_id

# OpenAI for AI analysis (optional but recommended)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key

# Your company details
COMPANY_NAME="Your Company Inc"
```

**Security note**: The `.env` file stays on your computer. Your credentials never leave your infrastructure.

### Step 3: Customize Date Ranges (2 min)

Open `software-roi-calculator-production.yaml` and adjust the analysis period:

```yaml
data_sources:
  salesforce_opportunities:
    options:
      params:
        q: "SELECT ... WHERE CloseDate >= LAST_N_MONTHS:6"
        # Change 6 to desired number of months
```

**Recommended ranges**:
- 6 months: Good for quarterly reviews
- 12 months: Good for annual analysis
- 3 months: Good for fast-growing companies tracking trends

### Step 4: Test Connection (3 min)

Run a test to verify your credentials work:

```bash
shedboxai run software-roi-calculator-production.yaml --verbose
```

**What you should see**:
```
Loading configuration from: software-roi-calculator-production.yaml

ðŸ“‚ Loading Data Sources (5 sources)
âœ“ salesforce_opportunities: 47 records loaded
âœ“ quickbooks_expenses: 23 records loaded
âœ“ hubspot_deals: 34 records loaded
âœ“ stripe_charges: 156 records loaded
âœ“ xero_invoices: 18 records loaded

ðŸ”„ Processing Pipeline (3 stages)
âœ“ contextual_filtering: 5 datasets created
âœ“ content_summarization: 4 summaries generated
âœ“ advanced_operations: 2 aggregations completed

âœ… Pipeline completed successfully
```

**If you see errors**:
- `401 Unauthorized` â†’ Check your API token
- `Connection refused` â†’ Check your instance URL
- `No data returned` â†’ Check your date range (might be too narrow)

### Step 5: Review Your First Analysis (3 min)

Open the generated file:

```bash
cat output/software-roi-analysis.json | python -m json.tool | head -50
```

You should see:

```json
{
  "software_costs_summary": {
    "TotalAmt_sum": 125000,
    "TotalAmt_mean": 5434.78,
    "TotalAmt_count": 23
  },
  "won_deals_summary": {
    "Amount_sum": 2340000,
    "Amount_mean": 49787.23,
    "Amount_count": 47
  },
  "roi_analysis": {
    "overall_roi": "1772% ROI over 6 months",
    "recommendations": [...]
  }
}
```

**Congratulations!** You just calculated your software ROI automatically.

### Step 6: Set Up Automated Runs (3 min)

Schedule monthly analysis:

**macOS/Linux (using cron)**:
```bash
# Edit crontab
crontab -e

# Add this line (runs 1st of every month at 9 AM):
0 9 1 * * cd /path/to/roi-calculator && shedboxai run software-roi-calculator-production.yaml
```

**Windows (using Task Scheduler)**:
```
1. Open Task Scheduler
2. Create Basic Task
3. Trigger: Monthly, 1st day, 9:00 AM
4. Action: Start program
   Program: C:\Python\python.exe
   Arguments: -m shedboxai.cli run C:\path\to\software-roi-calculator-production.yaml
```

**Cloud option (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)**:
- Upload config to cloud storage
- Create scheduled function to run monthly
- Save results to cloud storage or email

## Troubleshooting Common Setup Issues

### Issue: "Module not found: shedboxai"

**Cause**: ShedBoxAI not installed or wrong Python environment

**Fix**:
```bash
# Make sure you're using Python 3.8+
python --version

# Install ShedBoxAI
pip install shedboxai

# If using virtual environment:
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
pip install shedboxai
```

### Issue: "401 Unauthorized" errors

**Cause**: Expired or incorrect API credentials

**Fix**:
1. Verify token hasn't expired (most expire after 60-90 days)
2. Check for typos in `.env` file
3. Confirm API permissions include read access
4. Test credentials directly with `curl`:

```bash
# Test Salesforce
curl https://yourinstance.salesforce.com/services/data/v58.0/query?q=SELECT+Id+FROM+Opportunity+LIMIT+1 \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

### Issue: "No data returned" (0 records)

**Cause**: Date range too narrow or no matching data

**Fix**:
1. Expand date range: Change `LAST_N_MONTHS:6` to `LAST_N_MONTHS:12`
2. Check filter conditions match your data
3. Verify you have closed/won deals in the time period
4. Run test query directly in tool's interface (Salesforce Workbench, etc.)

### Issue: Template rendering fails

**Cause**: Missing fields or incorrect field names

**Fix**:
1. Check which fields exist in your actual data
2. Update template to use correct field names
3. Refer to `test-config.yaml` for working field mappings
4. See troubleshooting guide: https://shedboxai.com/docs/troubleshooting

## What to Do With Your Results

### Week 1: Identify Quick Wins

Look for:
- **Unused licenses**: Cancel immediately (avg. $28K/year saved)
- **Zombie subscriptions**: Former employee accounts still active
- **Redundant tools**: Multiple tools doing same job

### Week 2: Share with Finance

Create executive summary:
```
Software ROI Analysis - Q3 2024

Total Software Spend: $125,000
Revenue Attributed: $2,340,000
Overall ROI: 1,772%

Top Performers:
- Salesforce: 3,614% ROI
- Stripe: 9,900% ROI
- HubSpot: 2,261% ROI

Optimization Opportunities:
- Cut unused analytics licenses: $22K savings
- Eliminate duplicate CRM: $15K savings
- Downgrade design tool tier: $8K savings

Total Quick Wins: $45K/year
```

### Week 3: Implement Changes

- Cancel obvious waste
- Downgrade overprovisioned licenses
- Consolidate redundant tools

**Avoid cutting**:
- Anything with &gt;500% ROI
- Mission-critical infrastructure
- Tools with strong revenue attribution

### Week 4: Set Up Monthly Reviews

Schedule monthly 30-minute reviews:
- Check for new zombie subscriptions
- Monitor cost growth rate
- Track ROI changes over time
- Adjust tool usage based on performance

## Next-Level: Advanced Configuration

Once basic setup works, enhance with:

**Custom date ranges per tool**:
```yaml
salesforce_opportunities:
  query: "WHERE CloseDate >= 2024-01-01"  # Specific date

quickbooks_expenses:
  query: "WHERE TxnDate >= LAST_N_DAYS:90"  # Rolling 90 days
```

**Additional data sources**:
- Add your project management tool
- Include HR system for headcount data
- Connect marketing platforms

**Custom metrics**:
```yaml
advanced_operations:
  roi_by_department:
    source: "software_costs"
    group_by: "department"
    aggregate:
      total_cost: "SUM(TotalAmt)"
      avg_cost_per_person: "SUM(TotalAmt) / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id)"
```
