- **All created in under 10 minutes with Claude Code**

### Step 1: Download Sample Data

We've prepared realistic sample datasets for you to practice with:

**📁 Download Sample Files:**

- [📄 customers.csv](/sample-data/customers.csv) - Customer data with spending and status
- [📄 orders.json](/sample-data/orders.json) - Order history with categories
- 📄 sample-introspection.md - Pre-generated analysis (shown below)

:::info Quick Setup
1. Download all three files to a `tutorial-data` folder
2. Or copy the data shown below if you prefer manual setup
:::

**customers.csv** preview:
```csv
customer_id,name,email,total_spent,last_purchase_date,status
1001,Sarah Johnson,sarah.j@email.com,2450.00,2024-06-15,active
1002,Mike Chen,mike.chen@email.com,890.50,2024-05-22,active
1003,Emily Rodriguez,emily.r@email.com,5620.00,2024-07-01,premium
# ... 7 more realistic customer records
```

**orders.json** preview:
```json
[
  {
    "order_id": "ORD-2024-001",
    "customer_id": 1001,
    "amount": 150.00,
    "date": "2024-06-15",
    "category": "electronics",
    "product": "Wireless Headphones"
  }
  // ... 7 more order records
]
```

### Step 2: Run Data Introspection

ShedBoxAI's introspection feature automatically analyzes your data and detects schemas, relationships, and patterns.

```bash
# Navigate to your data folder
cd tutorial-data

# Run introspection on your data sources
shedboxai introspect customers.csv orders.json
```

**Expected Output:**
```markdown
# Data Source Analysis Report

## Source: customers.csv
- **Type**: CSV
- **Records**: 5 rows
- **Schema**:
  - customer_id: integer (unique identifier)
  - name: string (full names)
  - email: string (email addresses)
  - total_spent: decimal (monetary values, range: $340.25 - $5,620.00)
  - last_purchase_date: date (2024-03-10 to 2024-07-01)
  - status: categorical (active, premium, inactive)

## Source: orders.json
- **Type**: JSON Array
- **Records**: 2 rows  
- **Schema**:
  - order_id: string (format: ORD-YYYY-NNN)
  - customer_id: integer (foreign key to customers)
  - amount: decimal (monetary values)
  - date: date
  - category: categorical (electronics, fashion)

## Detected Relationships
- **customers.customer_id** ↔ **orders.customer_id** (one-to-many)

## Recommended Operations
- Contextual filtering on customer status or spending thresholds
- Relationship highlighting to join customer and order data
- Format conversion for customer segmentation
- AI analysis for customer behavior insights
```

### Step 3: Generate Configuration with Claude Code

Now comes the magic! Copy the introspection results and paste them into Claude Code with this prompt:

```
Using this ShedBoxAI data introspection, create a configuration that:

1. Identifies high-value customers (>$1000 total spent)
2. Joins customer data with their order history  
3. Segments customers into VIP, Premium, and Standard tiers
4. Generates AI-powered insights about customer behavior patterns
5. Includes both learning mode (store_only: true) and production mode options

[Paste your introspection results here]
```

**Claude Code will generate a complete configuration like this:**

```yaml
# Generated by Claude Code - Customer Analysis Pipeline
# Time saved: 3+ hours of manual configuration

data_sources:
  customers:
    type: csv
    path: customers.csv
    options:
      encoding: utf-8
      delimiter: ","
      
  orders:
    type: json
    path: orders.json

processing:
  # Filter for active high-value customers
  contextual_filtering:
    high_value_customers:
      source: customers
      conditions:
        - field: total_spent
          condition: "total_spent > 1000"
        - field: status
          condition: "status != 'inactive'"
  
  # Join customer and order data
  relationships:
    customer_order_analysis:
      primary_source: high_value_customers
      related_source: orders
      join_key: customer_id
      relationship_type: "one_to_many"
  
  # Create customer segments
  format_conversion:
    customer_segments:
      source: customer_order_analysis
      operations:
        - type: calculated_field
          field: tier
          expression: "total_spent > 5000 ? 'VIP' : (total_spent > 2000 ? 'Premium' : 'Standard')"
        - type: field_extraction
          fields: [customer_id, name, email, total_spent, tier, last_purchase_date]

### Step 4: Learning Mode vs Production Mode

ShedBoxAI's unique `store_only` feature lets you learn prompt engineering without spending money on API calls.

#### Learning Mode (`store_only: true`)
Perfect for understanding and education:

```yaml
ai_interface:
  prompt_storage:
    store_only: true  # Only generate prompts, don't call APIs
```

**Result**: Beautiful, complete prompts saved to files that you can:
- Use manually in ChatGPT or Claude
- Study to learn prompt engineering  
- Modify and improve
- Share with your team

#### Production Mode (`store_only: false`)  
For automated execution:

```yaml
ai_interface:
  model:
    type: rest
    url: https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${OPENAI_API_KEY}
      Content-Type: application/json
    options:
      model: gpt-4
      temperature: 0.7
  
  prompt_storage:
    store_only: false  # Store AND execute prompts
```

**Result**: Full automation with AI responses and prompt storage.

### Step 5: Run Your Configuration

```bash
# Save the generated config as customer-analysis.yaml
# Then run it:

shedboxai run customer-analysis.yaml
```

**Expected Results:**

**Learning Mode Output:**
- Prompt files saved to `generated_prompts/`
- Complete prompts ready for manual use
- No API costs incurred

**Production Mode Output:**
- `customer_analysis_results.json` with AI insights
- Prompt files for reference
- Complete customer segment analysis
